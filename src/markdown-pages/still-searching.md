### 3 More Weeks In....

Well i'll start this off by saying I have had one more interview! I thought it went well but apparently not. O well though it's all a learning experience right? I have read blogs watched youtube videos about all these different people trying to find their first jobs in web development. One thing that they all said was keep searching and perfecting your skillset. I am at the point where it feels like wow is this even worth it! Then I take a deep breathe and step away from the computer, and just think how far I have come and how much I have actually learned and accomplished. Before starting the bootcamp I knew nothing about web development and let me tell you now I am amazed at how much I have learned and built in under a year. That gives me hope to continue on this journey of learning and job hunting. I am going to keep my head up and just keep on keeping on:). Sooner or later a company will give me an oppurtunity and it will be all worth it! Morale of the story is if you job hunting and feeling lost and depressed that nothing good is happening within that keep your head up stay positive! Everything happens for a reason it's up to us to keep getting better and really take all of the negatives and turn them into positives:)! Don't lose faith my friends.
