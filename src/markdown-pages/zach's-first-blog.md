### Learning Everyday!

This is all about how web-development is a never ending learning expierience!

Since I started my coding career in 2020, I have not had a single day where I have not learned something new pertaining to web-development.
From new languages to new technologies and everything in between. It's very exciting but also very intimadating of course, but have faith because you will learn and perfect whatever you set out to do!! I have looked back from past projects when I first started and what do you know I am light-years ahead of where I started. Looking back it's safe to say that I have come a lllloooong way but also i'm very excited because I have soooo much more years of learning and mastering the art of coding.
