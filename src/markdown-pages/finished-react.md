### Finished Full Course on React!

Well here I am one month after completing the bootcamp I have another course down! Is's crazy how much more I learned not only about react but graphql as well.
This was I beleive a 40 or 45 hour course, and I can tell you now I know why react is one of the fastest growing frameworks in web development.
I know there is still soooo much to learn and practice but this course definatley was great and very informative on literally every aspect of react.
After completing it I can honestly say if you want to learn more about react by doing a massive project go on udemy.com and search react and take one of the courses.
That's all for now!!
