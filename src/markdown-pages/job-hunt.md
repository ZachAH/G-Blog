### I knew it would be hard but ooooo boy!!

Well everyone I am one month into my job search. To be honest it's not going well hahaha. I have applied at around at least 30 places with one interview and tons and I mean tons of rejection letters. Here is the deal though I have watched and read a lot of different videos and articles on job hunting for your first start in the tech industry. So with that being said I know the hardest part is getting that one company to take a chance and let you get your foot in the door so to speak. I will continue to code daily and keep applying for every entry level front-end developer job I see!!! This is all a learning experience and i'm just happy that companies are actually looking at my resume! Til next time! Hey maybe my next blog post i'll have a new job:).
